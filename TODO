    Done:
        ✔ Write business logic
            ✔ I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
            ✔ I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
            ✔ I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
            ✔ When the session is finished start automatically break (color Header title and action text should be changed)
            ✔ When the break is finished start automatically session (color Header title and action text should be changed)
            ✔ Add additional action text under current state field (while session - focus on work, while break - relax or something like this)
            ✔ While session is started and paused and session time changed timer should be updated (only session time could be changed)
            ✔ While break is started and paused and break time changed timer should be updated (only break time could be changed)
        ✔ While session or break is running the time frames could not be changed
        ✔ Build UI
        ✔ Correct e2e test
        ✔ Write Unit tests
        ✔ Deploy on gh-pages
        ✔ Deploy on codepen
        
    Canceled:
        ✘ Add additional button for timer reset -> Not necessarily anymore
        ✘ While session or break is if reset button pressed show dialog window with request to interrupt pomodoro -> Not necessarily anymore
        ✘ And if it possible by time - add spinner when Angular component loading -> Will be in next task
